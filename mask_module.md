# Mask Creation Module

This module will handle the creation and management of binary masks for numbers (1-10) and capital letters (A-Z).

## Goals
- Store each character as a binary (0/1) mask
- Provide functions to retrieve and possibly generate masks
- Make it easy to extend with new shapes or custom masks

## Tasks
- [ ] Decide on mask storage format (e.g., Python lists, numpy arrays, or image files)
- [ ] Implement functions to load and retrieve masks
- [ ] Add sample masks for a few characters (e.g., '1', 'A') as a starting point
- [ ] Document the mask creation process

---

Implementation will be in a dedicated Python module (e.g., `mask.py`).
