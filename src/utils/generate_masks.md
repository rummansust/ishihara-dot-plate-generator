# Mask Image Generation

This script generates binary mask images for numbers (1-10) and capital letters (A-Z) using the Comic Sans font. Each mask is a black-and-white PNG image, where white pixels represent the shape to be filled with dots.

- Output directory: `src/masks/`
- Font: Comic Sans MS (must be installed on your system)

---

You can run this script to generate all mask images automatically.
